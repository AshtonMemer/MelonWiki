This can increase performance on some Ryzen CPUs by up to 100% (45â†’90 FPS), with 8-core 2700X/3700X seeing those gains. Play with mod settings to tune it to your own system. If you use it on a different CPU, please share your results! Obviously this only helps with CPU performance, it won't help if you're bottlenecked by your GPU.
