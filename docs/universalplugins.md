# Universal Plugins

## What Are Plugins

Plugins are always loaded before Mods. Because of this, they're especially useful for creating mod auto-updaters. There are many other usages for plugins though.<br>

All plugin files should be put in the `Plugins` folder, which will be located in your game's directory.

!> Plugins and Mods are **NOT** compatible. Do not place Plugins in the `Mods` folder.
