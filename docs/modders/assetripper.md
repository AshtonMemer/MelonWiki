# AssetRipper

[AssetRipper](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper) is a tool for reverse engineering Unity games. It creates Unity projects from compiled games and asset bundles.

## Uses

### Static Game Inspection

Ripped Unity projects allow you to inspect the game structure before any game code runs.

### Mod Recovery

Sometimes projects get lost. Sometimes a previous author only published source code and forgot about the Unity project. These things happen, and AssetRipper can help get you back to a decent starting point.

### Asset Extraction

Although recompiling games from ripped projects is still a pipe dream, ripped projects contain nearly all the game assets in a compatible format for Unity. 

### ThunderKit

AssetRipper generates projects compatible with [ThunderKit](https://github.com/PassivePicasso/ThunderKit).

## Installation

* The latest [release](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper/releases) can be found [here](https://github.com/AssetRipper/AssetRipper/releases/latest).
