# Getting Started

MelonLoader is a mod loader working on most unity games. It has initially been designed to focus Il2Cpp games, but also supports Mono games.<br/>
To use it, you will first need to install it to the desired game.

!> Please note that MelonLoader doesn't do anything on its own. You will have to install some mods to make changes to your game.


# Automated Installation

- Down due to Microsoft Windows Defender breaking it with a False Positive.
- Will be back soon.
